# Projet Prototype

!!! danger "READ ME"
    Note that any of these changes are stuff that I intended to do. Execution is
    offten different because well its hard to balance but also because I will
    also consider what you all think

The objective of Project Prototype is 3 fold

1. Give each weapon a niche
2. Use the 212th weapons
3. Change everything to be better? Well as much as I can :)



There are changes to ammo,mags and weapons. Additionaly theres bullet drop, as in the bullet will just go down.

## Weapons

Firstly each gun will have 2 mags. The first mag is a shared mag between all
weapons, I call it **Republic Universal Magazine**, aka **RUM**. The second mag
will be weapon specific. For example the Z6s 300 round mag, the 15a rifles 30
round, the LE's 20 round, the Mod-0's 240 round, and the carbines 100 round.

I will now list the changes for each weapon.

??? note "DC-15a"
    - Semi and 2 round burst (top right icon shows 3 round,buts its 2 round)
    - Much more recoil compared to now
    - The DC-15a mag has much highher damage, can 1-2 shot b1's, atleast thats what I want.

??? note "DC-15a GL"
    - Same as rifle
    - The biggest change is that the GL sight should be better

??? note "DC-15s Carbine"
    - Literally the highest RPM, 1000 RPM
    - Lowest damage ofcourse.
    - Like almost no recoil
    - King of CQC 😊

??? note "Z6"
    - Second highest RPM
    - Scope, atleast better one
    - Good for low to med range.

??? note "Mod-0 LSD"
    - Less damage then rifle,more then carbine
    - Ment for long range.
    - Dank ass model?

??? note "DC-15 LE"
    - Lowkey might have accidently made into an anti material gun, opps.

## Hierarchy

Im going to try to my best order the guns on different stats. **Left** is lowest/worst, **right** is highest/best


!!! info "Damage:
    carbine < Mod-0 < Rifle = GL < Z6 < LE
