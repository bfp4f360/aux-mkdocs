# <span style="color:gold">Project Prototype</span> 

!!! danger "READ ME"
    Note that any of these changes are stuff that I intended to do. Execution is
    offten different because well its hard to balance but also because I will
    also consider what you all think. With that being said, what is in game is following this doc as much as possible.

The objective of Project Prototype is 3 fold

1. Give each weapon a niche
2. Use the 212th weapons cause swop man big bad
3. Change everything to be better ðŸ˜Ž.


## <span style="color:gold">Weapons</span> 

Firstly each gun will have 2 mags. The first mag is a shared mag between all
weapons, It is called **<span style="color:cyan">Republic Universal Magazine</span>**, I perfer people call it **<span style="color:cyan">RUM</span>**. The only exception is that the DC-15a/DC-15a GL has just this mag, so another way to word is that the DC-15a mag is shared across all guns. The second mag
will be weapon specific to try and give meaning to that weapons role. Here are the weapons and their changes along with what their special mag is.

==Note:== All the guns have flashlight/ IR laser attachment since the 212th added those, so wowe.


Also the mag icons where made by ==Kestrel==, plz say big thank to him,thank.

??? note "DC-15a"
    ### DC-15a
    Make it good at short to medium ranges, a battle rifle in a sense.
    #### Weapon
    - 600 RPM
    - Semi and 2 round burst (top right icon shows 3 round,buts its 2 round)
    - Much more recoil compared to now
    - x6 scopes
    #### Magazine
    - 30 rounds
    - 500 m/second
    - same weight as current low mag.
    #### Ammo
    - Much more damage, 3-4 shots b1's on chest, but due to how swop is its a little inconsistant.

??? note "DC-15a GL"
    ### DC-15a GL
    - Carry the same changes over from rifle
    #### Magazine
    - The magazine for the HE and AP rounds have their velocities tweaked so that they are with in +/- 1 meter of where you aim. So if a target is at 200 meters and you zero at 200 meters, your shot will be with in 1 meter, atleast I was able to get that.

    Biggest change is that you have an actualy GL sight. No more random guessing

??? note "DC-15s Carbine"
    ### DC-15s 
    Make it the king of CQC

## <span style="color:gold">Hierarchy</span>

Im going to try to my best order the guns on different stats. **Left** is lowest/worst, **right** is highest/best


!!! info "Damage"
    ### Damage
    carbine < Mod-0 < (Rifle = GL) < Z6 < LE

    
!!! info "RPM"
    ### RPM
    LE < (Rifle = GL) < Mod-0 < Z6 < Carbine

!!! info "Bullet drop"
    ### Bullet drop
    Right is lowest bullet drop, aka strightest path

    Z6 <  carbine < (Rifle = GL)  < Mod-0 < LE

!!! info "Mag weight"
    ### Mag weight
    carbine < (Rifle = GL) < LE < Mod - 0 < Z6

!!! info "Mag Capacity"
    ### Mag Capacity
    LE < (Rifle = GL) < Mod-0 < Z6 < Carbine

As you can see, I try my best to make each gun being the best at one area,and worst at one area. I try.

## <span style="color:gold">Unit changes</span>

### B2

The B2 technically got an armor buff,but due to how strong the weapons are its more or less a nerf compared to the current version. In future I wil work on this but for now its okay

### DSD/EKKA

These two had slight armor rework to match currrent values to the new ones.

## <span style="color:gold">Particle Effects</span>

The particle effects are the same ones from the 212th aux, but turned way down for the sake of having less impact, even though they though they dont cause that much frame loss I wanted to still reduce them because sometimes too much spark is bad F.

## <span style="color:gold">Reasons for some of the stuff</span>

??? question "Why bullet drop" 
    * The bullet drop was added for the LE. If theres
    no bullet drop then the bullets go a few mills above the crosshairs which is
    annoying. Now if you aim at the head of a b1 at 1km, your gonna hit the
    head. If you aim at 2km slightly above you will still hit the head

    * Also the bullet drop adds one more thing I can use to make weapons distinct.

??? question "Why 2 mags" 
    * To give each gun a choice. 
    * The carbine can use the RUM mag for more damage, but loses the potential to just spray and pray.
    * The LE can carry RUM if it wants to be able to put more shots down and use its special mag for B2, DSD, Droidekka and so on
    * The Z6 is the only one that doesnt really have a reason other then you can share mags
    * The Mod 0 would use RUM mags if it wants to do more damage, at the cost of velocity and bullet drop.

??? question "Why are the damage order like they are" 
    * The rifle is the backbone so it makes sense why its in the middle.
    * The placement of LE and carbine to me are also trivial
    * So that just leaves the Z6 and Mod 0. How can I make the Z6 do good at CQC? make it have good damage. It cant do too good at long range cause of recoil, accuracy, bullet drop and velocity and if you do try and succeed your just wasting its potential. The mod 0 has the 2nd to last damage so that it doesnt out perform the Z6 at close range, but still does better at long range due to accuracy,velocity and drop.

??? question "Why a RUM bottle icon for RUM mag" 
    * You think I would give up this chance to make a meme.
