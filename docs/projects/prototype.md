# Project Prototype

!!! danger "READ ME"
    Note that any of these changes are stuff that I intended to do. Execution is
    offten different because well its hard to balance but also because I will
    also consider what you all think

The objective of Project Prototype is 3 fold

1. Give each weapon a niche
2. Use the 212th weapons
3. Change everything to be better? Well as much as I can :)

!!! danger "MAG"
    Im thinking of making the DC-15a rifle be the universal mag instead of having two for it.

There are changes to ammo,mags and weapons. Additionaly theres bullet drop, as in the bullet will just go down.

## Weapons

Firstly each gun will have 2 mags. The first mag is a shared mag between all
weapons, I call it **Republic Universal Magazine**, aka **RUM**. The second mag
will be weapon specific. For example the Z6s 300 round mag, the 15a rifles 30
round, the LE's 20 round, the Mod-0's 240 round, and the carbines 100 round.

I will now list the changes for each weapon.

??? note "DC-15a"
    - Semi and 2 round burst (top right icon shows 3 round,buts its 2 round)
    - Much more recoil compared to now
    - The DC-15a mag has much highher damage, can 1-2 shot b1's, atleast thats what I want.

??? note "DC-15a GL"
    - Same as rifle
    - The biggest change is that the GL sight should be better

??? note "DC-15s Carbine"
    - Literally the highest RPM, 1000 RPM
    - Lowest damage ofcourse.
    - Like almost no recoil
    - King of CQC ðŸ˜Š

??? note "Z6"
    - Second highest RPM
    - Scope, atleast better one
    - Good for low to med range.

??? note "Mod-0 LSD"
    - Less damage then rifle,more then carbine
    - Ment for long range.
    - Dank ass model?

??? note "DC-15 LE"
    - Lowkey might have accidently made into an anti material gun, opps.

## Hierarchy

Im going to try to my best order the guns on different stats. **Left** is lowest/worst, **right** is highest/best


!!! info "Damage"
    carbine < Mod-0 < (Rifle = GL) < Z6 < LE

    
!!! info "RPM"
    LE < (Rifle = GL) < Mod-0 < Z6 < Carbine

!!! info "Bullet drop"
    Right is lowest bullet drop, aka strightest path

    Z6 <  carbine < (Rifle = GL)  < Mod-0 < LE

!!! info "Mag weight"
    carbine < (Rifle = GL) < LE < Mod - 0 < Z6

!!! info "Mag Capacity"
    LE < (Rifle = GL) < Mod-0 < Z6 < Carbine

As you can see, I try my best to make each gun being the best at one area,and worst at one area. I try.
