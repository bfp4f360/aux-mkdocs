# Changelog

Im going to follow the way Ubuntu does their versioning because I think its pretty cool but with a slight change. Heres how it will be

```
Year.month.day
```

So for example 19.11.12 would be the 2019, 11th month, 12th day.

The next thing is that some of these change logs where made before I started using mkdocs, so I will call those legacy changelogs.

Finally the changelogs will be ordered by release date,newest at top.
