    ![f][ur_idea]

### Chaingun

!!! bug 
    - Buffed damage, just so its not a stright copy pasta of Z6, plus I expect it to be limited in numbers so might as well make it useful.
    - Easer to engage at long range, aka reduced the bullet drop effect,u can aim at 500 and hit, u still have to aim up for say at 1km.
    - 1000rnd mag, mag weight is increased to match.
    - Uses same scope as other rifles.
    - Has a capital X now.

### Other

- Just some other bug fixies, nothing too major. Other then that swop is broken ðŸ˜¢
