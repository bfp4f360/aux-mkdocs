### Chaingun

!!! bug 
    - Added submunition to mimic penetrator, since its rocket technically it seems to need a penetrator.
    - Made the mag 1000rnd, increased the size of mag to be now x3.33 of z6 mag (400 round vs 1000 round which is x2.5 ratio). The main idea is that u hold the fire button to max the recoil out, kind of like the Negev in CSGO lol.
    This means theres 30 seconds of continous fire (2k rpm ,1k mag size, math is ez), so you would hold the fire button then aim down and follow tracers to watever u wanna hit.
    - Every 4th shot is a tracer. For the sake of frames.
    - Uses same scope as other rifles.
    - Has a capital X now.
