## <span style="color:gold">Fixies Wixies</span><font size="1">( Kill me!!!! )</font>

### Vulture CAS Module
Fixed by adding back the old vulture weapons, consider this a buff to vulture.

!!! bug "CI Mystic"
    Title: Advance CAS  
    Description: Advance CAS module doesn't work  
    Severity: Low(ish)  
    Reproducibility: Spawn in a vulture and try to use. Says aircraft have no gun  
    Modlist: Standard

### LAAT-C Being garbage
Fixed by making the LAAT-C slingload the Bantha, also LAAT Mk.III and MK.IV can sling load too, so LAAT-C is obsolete just like you.

!!! bug "CX-C Galaxy"
    Title: New LAAT/c and the Mynock glitch  
    Description: when you take out the new LAAT/C (the one that can fit 24 ppl) and you pick up mynock with magnetic clamps they colide in your hitbox. When you end up unclamping them, because of this they blow you up.   
    Reproducibility: Unknown(because no one knows about the new one)  
    Severity: High (mynock may not be able to use super Sabre)  
    Mod list: Standard  

!!! bug "CX-W Whisler"
    Title: LAAT/C
    Description: When flying the LAAT/C Mk II (Unknown if its the same for the other variant) it becomes extremely unstable and glitches around the place flying every which way. have had at least 3 instances of this happening.  
    Reproducibility: Common, Attach a vehicle and fly  
    Severity: High (Basically unflyable)  
    Mod List: Standard  

## <span style="color:gold">New Weapons/Changes</span>

!!! info "DC-17 Flares n Smoke"
    Access to 1 round flare n smoke ammo, same as DC-15a GL, even hunt IR.

!!! info "DC-17a"
    Basicly a Dc-17 that can go full auto, and has an extra mag thats 40 rounds. But how is this not better then the DC-17? Because it wont have access to the smoke and flares :)

!!! info "Chaingun Z-6x"
    Chaingun. yes. I mean im the one who made it all work so I guess I should put it in? Heres some things to note

    - 2k RPM
    - Disperssion is very low, as such theres high recoil to counter that fact. I tried to change disperssion but it didnt work.
    - Shoots same ammo as z6.
    - Camera shake.
    - 500 round mag, heavy tho. More then twice that of Z6.
    - Has an X cause its mutha fucking G and takes no shit from no one ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜ .

!!! info "212th Skooma Jumppack"
    Added a 212th skinned Skooma jumppack.

## <span style="color:gold">New submod</span> 

Not sure if submod is the best way to say this,but this is made by ==Mirror==. Basicly tells you when someone is medicing on you with their custom message. Heres examples below.

??? tip "How to set up"
    Look under `Game>Configure Addons` just like you would if you wanna change for example DUI settings or watever.

    The default is `"%1 is asking that you kindly hold still."` The `%1` means your name so if you want your name to show up, just put `%1` whereever.
    ![settings][mednoti_setting]

    This will show "Mirror is big gay wowe" to anyone I open medical menu for.

??? tip "How message looks"
    Look at top right
    ![how it looks][how_message_looks]

## <span style="color:gold">New Optional Mods</span> 

### ACE TFAR Long Range Setter
By ==Chatter== and ==Mirror==, saves and sets LR and SR profiles that set your frequencies and which ear its on plus additional channels, becuase setting up radios takes too long. ARF will still stay in, but if you want more functionality you can use it.  
Get it [here](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1909836103).

### ACE Vehicle Medical
By ==Mirror==, shows individuals based on how injured they are while you are in a vehicle.  
Get it [here](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1911374016)

## <span style="color:gold">Plans for next updates</span>

### DSD/Droidekka

I plan to rework the guns of them to be slightly more distinct. 

- DSD will be a long range, slow rof but accurate little snipy boi with HE. 
- Droidekka will become even more of a machine gun then it is now, so for CQC type shit. Reduced accuracy

Maybe ill change armor around but for now its okay.

### Weapons

I am switching from SWOP to 212th weapons, as stated in [here](../../../current_projects#project-prototype) under `Project Prototype` or you can go directly to the page [here](../../../projects/prototype/). 

### Project Light

Yes, enter the light my children. Im not gonna say what this is till it comes out, but ==Kestral== knows ![settings][lenny]
