!!! bug "Droidekka by Swanny"

    
    Moveable Droidika  
    Description: placing down the movable droidika spawns the camo one rather than the silver/orange one  
    Severity: low  
    Reproductability: Just place down a normal movable decka  
    Mods: standard  
    
### Moving DSD/Ekka/OG
Potentially fixed the bug, but I cant be sure cause I dont have my own server to test on. F

!!! bug "Post Mortem by Craz"


    
    Title:  DSD Moving  
    Description: The DSD Was moving despite being burning and dead. It didn't fire any shots however. Shooting at the legs of it where there's an invisible man didn't help either.
