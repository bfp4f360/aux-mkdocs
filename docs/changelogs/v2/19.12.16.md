# Patch ~~19.12.01~~ ~~19.12.08~~ ~~19.12.15~~ 19.12.16

Wowe fixes. As u can see, am lazy and keep delaying.

## <span style="color:gold">New Prototype weapons</span>

These are the weapons that ive been working on with the other MOS bois and other people for the past 4 months. While not 100% ready for use,they are good enough to be tried out by yall plus that fact that there will be no aux update for a month. For more info go [here](https://aux-mkdocs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/projects/prototype/). 

I ask that since its winter stand down that if you have some sort of squad training that you get permission to try these weapons or, maybe get permision to try them out in a fun op. If you have any problems or questions obviously ask me lol. 

Now theres also a `B2 (TEST)`,`TEST - DSD 1` and `TEST - Ekka 1` in zeus/eden so if you do test the weapons and wanna have a b2/dsd/ekka use those. They are under the RD501 Factions with the normal b2/dsd/ekka.

### Camo is not camo on Ekka
Fixed texture

!!! bug "Droidekka by Swanny"

    
    Moveable Droidika  
    Description: placing down the movable droidika spawns the camo one rather than the silver/orange one  
    Severity: low  
    Reproductability: Just place down a normal movable decka  
    Mods: standard  
    
### Moving DSD/Ekka/OG
Potentially fixed the bug, but I cant be sure cause I dont have my own server to test on. F

!!! bug "Post Mortem by Craz"


    
    Title:  DSD Moving  
    Description: The DSD Was moving despite being burning and dead. It didn't fire any shots however. Shooting at the legs of it where there's an invisible man didn't help either.  
    Severity: low  
    reproducibility: unknown   
    Mod list: Standard 501st + DUI
