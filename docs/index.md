There are some things in this mod that I didnt make my self that where made by others. These are the things I didnt make my self that I asked if I could put in this mod, atleast the big ones I remember there might be stuff I found on forums that I simply cant remember or because I am human.

??? info "Blast Refraction"
    ### Blast Refraction
    This basicly adds a refraction effect to most explosives. It was made by Taros from CUP, and as such its pretty fucking lit.
    [Here](https://forums.bohemia.net/forums/topic/221306-refraction-blast-wave/) is a link to the BI forum about it.

??? info "BF3 style thermals"
    ### BF3 style thermals
    This mod basicly edits the thermal file to add on a bf3 style thermal. Now normally instead of putting someone elses mod in yours, you would just list it as a dependency or something. However due to the way thermals work in Arma as its a png file, you cant do that. So I asked the creator if I could add his thermal colors in. [Heres](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1799993760) the original steam page.

??? info "Aircraft Boost script"
    ### Aircraft Boost script
    I started modding in Arma because of this lol. while this isnt just yet,I would like to make my own but these guys made a pretty good one better then anything I could make so I ask if I can edit and use it. [Heres](https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/?id=743099837) the mod.

## <span style="color:gold">Jumppack</span> 
I suspect that alot of ppl outside will like the jumppack, so assuming you are willing to use SWOP (**dies inside**) you can do the following to have our own jumppack. ==NOTE:== I will soon make a standalone mod for non swop ppl.
