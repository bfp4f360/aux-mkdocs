# Current Projects

These are current major projects that I am working on that are noteworthy because they have made enough progress to be interesting. 

??? success "Project Skooma Jumppack"
    Making a custom jumppack script with as much flexiblity as possible.
    Features one time use jumppacks, jumppacks with different energy capcities,
    recharge rates and differnet jumps. This mod has been successfuly implimented into aux mod.

??? warning "Project Prototype"
    SWOP is big bad. So lets start moving our weapons to the 212th ones. At the
    same time lets impliment some large weapon reforms. They are:

    - Each gun will have a universal magazine that is shared across almost all weapons
    - Each gun will then aditionaly have a special magazine that plays towards that guns features. For example Z6 will have a 300 or so round mag because its a machine gun right.
    - Bullet drop, the bullet will only go down, no bullet friction or air effecting if it goes left or right.
    - Each gun has a niche. Carbine has the highest rate of fire, lowest recoil but lowest damage. LE has highest damage and can engage better at long ranges.

    As you can see most of these, if not all, are geared towards the ideas brought by the TCW mod team but in quicker, more balanced, less prettier but more functional fashion.

    Currently in private testing phase, will soon be up for Acklay test 😃

??? warning "Project Light"
    Big suprise,involves reskinning a special droid.

    Textures have been made, just gotta impliment and test.
