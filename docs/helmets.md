# Helmet guidelines 

Welcome to the helmet guidelines page. Just read through this and it should answer all your questions. Some things are collpased by the way to save space :) look under this for what I mean

??? note "CLICK ME ðŸ˜ "
    Spooky ðŸ‘»ðŸ‘»ðŸ‘», Flux says hi. ( Í¡Â° ÍœÊ– Í¡Â°)

    ![flux_helmet][flux_helm]

## People who make the helmets

==**Sam:**== Will be the lead for texturing for the mod. If you have questions ask him.  
==**Calo:**== Will be in charge of Airborne related textures.  
==**Casskun:**== Will be incharge of Aviation related textures, helmets ,vehicles and whatever.  
==**Kestral:**== Will be in charge of Infantry textures and other miscellaneous textures.  

All other textures will be spread across these 4.

These folks will get in contact with you, depending on where you are, regarding your helmet.

## Process

### Google Form

!!! info "Helmet Submitions"
    [This](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfhZW5Uv62KyTxiCFaFDw6OoL8ng-DfEJ36BJFzDxDBEqX_iA/viewform) is the new Google Form for helmet submission.

    [This](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1dAYhbEN5ca_bCJ147h4vnMr5gKZ6Z3Uze4Y-N6XSvfA/edit#gid=184053813) is the Google Spreadsheet for responses.



### Apporval Processes

??? note "AB,Infantry and Aviation"
    1. Design your helmet with the base template. 
    2. Once your done, submit the texture to the forum [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdRKswPFHkU03VbGv9LXHPPz_WpMMbagMCvZkUCRBz3xkbcJg/viewform)
    3. If your helmet is rejected by the texturer then apply changes said texturer said/suggests.
    4. Once the texturer has accepted the helmet and meets the guidelines, the template will be sent to youe direct CoC for acceptance. If CoC denies then remake helmet with their specifications
    5. Texturer will then texture the helmet and finally show an ingame preview of the helmet to both you and your direct CoC for acceptance.
    6. After this final acceptance the helmet will be put in queue to be put in mod.
    7. enjoy ðŸ˜Š.

??? note "ARC"
    Follow the same as infantry, but instead of using the templates for veteran/CS the arc member would use their squad helmet as a template and if applicable use the team template. Its a little bit confusing so lets break it down.

    1. There are two squads,**Verda** and **Adenn**
    2. Each squad has 2 teams, this brings the total number of templats to 6
    3. If you are the squad leader you use the squad template (**Verda** or **Adenn**)
    4. If you are in the team, you would use the team template (**Triton** and **Beskar** for **Verda** and then **Cyrus** and **Solus** for **Adenn**)
    5. Follow the normal Infantry guidelines.

    Heres a nice little chart.

    ```md
    â”œâ”€â”€ ARC Command
    â”œâ”€â”€â”€â”€ **Custom Helmet**

    â”œâ”€â”€ Verda Squad
    â”œâ”€â”€â”€â”€ Squad Leader
    â”œâ”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€ **Use Verda template**
    â”œâ”€â”€â”€â”€ Team Triton
    â”œâ”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€ **Use Triton template**
    â”œâ”€â”€â”€â”€ Team Beskar
    â”œâ”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€ **Use Beskar template**

    â”œâ”€â”€ Adenn Squad
    â”œâ”€â”€â”€â”€ Squad Leader
    â”œâ”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€ **Use Adenn template**
    â”œâ”€â”€â”€â”€ Team Cyrus
    â”œâ”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€ **Use Cyrus template**
    â”œâ”€â”€â”€â”€ Team Solus
    â”œâ”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€ **Use Solus template**

    â”œâ”€â”€ Not in ARC
    â””â”€â”€â”€â”€ Nothing :(
    ```

    So let me give you an example. Say theres person X,Y and Z. X and Y are in Cyrus and Person Z is the squad leader and thus in Adenn. X and Y would use the Cyrus template and person Z would use the Adenn template.
